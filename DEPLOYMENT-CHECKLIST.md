# OAuth Integration Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Setup (COMPLETED)

### Google Cloud Console Configuration
- [x] Project created and configured
- [x] APIs enabled (Calendar, Gmail, Drive, Sheets)
- [x] Web application OAuth credentials created
- [x] iOS application OAuth credentials created
- [x] OAuth consent screen configured
- [x] Redirect URIs configured:
  - `https://voiceassistant-floe-production.up.railway.app/api/oauth/google/callback`
- [x] Scopes configured (Calendar, Gmail, Drive, Sheets, Profile, Email)

### iOS App Configuration
- [x] Bundle ID set to `com.amitstoerkel.VoiceAssistant`
- [x] GoogleService-Info.plist added to project
- [x] Info.plist updated with OAuth URL schemes
- [x] OAuth integration views implemented

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Set Railway Environment Variables
```bash
# Required OAuth variables
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=899362685715-cspn... # Your web client ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret_here

# URLs
BACKEND_URL=https://voiceassistant-floe-production.up.railway.app
FRONTEND_URL=com.amitstoerkel.VoiceAssistant://oauth

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your_32_plus_character_secret_here
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_32_plus_character_refresh_secret_here
```

### Step 2: Deploy OAuth System
```bash
# In the backend directory
npm run deploy-oauth
```

### Step 3: Test Backend Health
```bash
# Check if backend is running
curl https://voiceassistant-floe-production.up.railway.app/health
```

### Step 4: Test OAuth Endpoints
```bash
# Test Google OAuth init (should return 401 without auth)
curl https://voiceassistant-floe-production.up.railway.app/api/oauth/google/init
```

### Step 5: Update iOS App Configuration
- [ ] Update APIClient base URL to Railway backend
- [ ] Verify OAuth URL schemes in Info.plist
- [ ] Test OAuth flow from iOS app

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Health endpoint responds: `/health`
- [ ] OAuth endpoints respond: `/api/oauth/google/init`
- [ ] Database migration successful
- [ ] Test user created successfully
- [ ] JWT tokens working correctly

### iOS App Testing
- [ ] OAuth flow initiates correctly
- [ ] Safari opens with Google OAuth
- [ ] Deep link returns to app
- [ ] Integration status shows connected
- [ ] Error handling works properly

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Complete OAuth flow from iOS app
- [ ] Token storage in database
- [ ] Token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Integration management (connect/disconnect)
- [ ] Service API calls (when implemented)

## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Railway Logs
```bash
# Monitor OAuth events
railway logs --filter="oauth"

# Watch for errors
railway logs --filter="error"

# Follow all logs
railway logs --follow
```

### Health Checks
- [ ] Backend health endpoint
- [ ] Database connectivity
- [ ] OAuth endpoint responses
- [ ] Token refresh success rates

## 🔐 Security Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is 32+ characters
- [ ] JWT_REFRESH_SECRET is 32+ characters
- [ ] OAuth credentials are set correctly
- [ ] No secrets in version control

### OAuth Configuration
- [ ] Redirect URIs match exactly
- [ ] State parameter validation working
- [ ] Token encryption in database
- [ ] Proper scope limitations

## 📱 iOS App Deployment

### Pre-Build Checklist
- [ ] GoogleService-Info.plist in project
- [ ] Info.plist URL schemes correct
- [ ] Bundle ID matches OAuth config
- [ ] APIClient points to Railway backend

### Build Configuration
- [ ] Development build for testing
- [ ] Production build for App Store
- [ ] Proper code signing
- [ ] Entitlements configured

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **OAuth Redirect Mismatch**
   - Solution: Verify redirect URI exactly matches Railway URL
   
2. **Missing Environment Variables**
   - Solution: Run `npm run validate-deployment`
   
3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Solution: Check Railway database service
   
4. **Token Refresh Failures**
   - Solution: Monitor logs and check refresh token validity

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Validate deployment
npm run validate-deployment

# Check database
npx prisma db push --preview-feature

# Test OAuth flow
curl -X GET https://voiceassistant-floe-production.up.railway.app/api/oauth/integrations
```
