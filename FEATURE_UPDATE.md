# Voice Assistant Feature Update

## New Features Added

### 1. Modern Particle Animation

A beautiful, responsive particle animation system has been added to the main screen that reacts to voice input:

- **Voice Response**: Particles vibrate and expand based on real-time audio levels when recording
- **AI Response**: Smooth wave-like motion during AI audio playback
- **Touch Interaction**: Particles respond to touch gestures with repulsion effects
- **Depth Layers**: Multi-layered particle system for visual depth
- **Adaptive Colors**: Different particle colors for different states (idle, recording, playing)

#### Technical Details:
- `ParticleBackgroundView.swift`: Main particle animation view
- `AudioLevelDetector.swift`: Real-time audio level monitoring using AVAudioRecorder
- 120 particles with organic brownian motion
- 60 FPS animation using Timer
- Gradient effects for each particle

### 2. Light/Dark Mode Support

Complete theme support has been implemented:

- **Manual Control**: Users can switch between Light, Dark, or System themes in Settings
- **System Integration**: Automatic theme switching based on iOS system appearance
- **Adaptive UI**: All UI elements properly adapt to both light and dark modes
- **Persistent Preferences**: Theme choice is saved using @AppStorage

#### Components Updated:
- `ThemeManager.swift`: Centralized theme management
- `SimpleContentView.swift`: Adaptive backgrounds and text colors
- `SimpleSettingsView.swift`: Theme picker control
- `MessageBubble`: Adaptive chat bubble colors
- Assets.xcassets: Added adaptive color sets

### 3. Enhanced Visual Design

- **Particle Colors**:
  - Dark Mode: Bright blue (recording), Purple (AI response), Light gray-blue (idle)
  - Light Mode: Deep blue (recording), Deep purple (AI response), Dark gray (idle)
- **Glow Effects**: Subtle glow during high audio levels
- **Smooth Transitions**: All theme and state changes animate smoothly

## Usage

### Testing the Particle Animation

1. Run the app and observe the idle particle animation
2. Tap the microphone button to start recording - particles will react to your voice
3. Stop recording to see the AI response animation
4. Touch and drag on the screen to interact with particles

### Switching Themes

1. Tap the gear icon to open Settings
2. Find the "Appearance" section
3. Select between System, Light, or Dark themes
4. The app will immediately update to reflect your choice

### Demo View

A demo view is available for testing: `ParticleAnimationDemo.swift`
- Toggle voice active/audio playing states
- Adjust audio level with slider
- Switch themes in real-time

## Performance Considerations

- Particle animation runs at 60 FPS with minimal CPU usage
- Audio level detection samples at 20 Hz (every 50ms)
- Smooth value interpolation reduces visual jitter
- Efficient Canvas rendering using SwiftUI

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the particle system:
- Audio frequency analysis for more nuanced reactions
- Customizable particle density and behavior
- Additional visual effects (trails, connections between particles)
- Haptic feedback integration
