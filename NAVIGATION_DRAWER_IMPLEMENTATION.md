# Navigation Drawer Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a navigation drawer for the settings page that slides in from the right, replacing the previous sheet presentation.

  - Semi-transparent overlay background
  - Dismissible by tapping overlay or swiping right
  - Smooth animations (0.3s duration)
  - Theme-aware background colors
  - Takes up 85% of screen width

### 2. SimpleContentView.swift (Modified)

### 3. SimpleSettingsView.swift (Modified)
- Added dismiss environment variable
- Added close button (X) in navigation toolbar

  - EnhancedVoiceInterface.swift
  - HomeDashboardView.swift

## Usage
The navigation drawer is automatically triggered when the settings gear icon is tapped in the toolbar. Users can dismiss it by:
1. Tapping the X button in the settings view
2. Tapping outside the drawer on the overlay
3. Swiping the drawer to the right

## Features

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Run the app in simulator
2. Tap the gear icon in the top-right corner
3. The settings should slide in from the right
4. Test dismissal methods (tap overlay, swipe, X button)
5. Verify theme switching still works properly
