# OAuth Integration Fix Summary

## Problem
The iOS app was correctly sending Google OAuth status (`google.connected: true`) but the backend was not recognizing it and returning "you need to connect to Google" error messages.

## Root Cause
1. The backend's `/api/voice/process-text` endpoint was not extracting the `integrations` field from the request body
2. The email agent was only checking the database for OAuth status, not the integration status passed from the iOS app

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Voice Controller (`voice.controller.js`)
- Added extraction of `integrations` from request body:
  ```javascript
  const { text, context = {}, platform = 'ios', integrations = {} } = req.body;
  ```
- Added integrations to the enhanced context passed to agents:
  ```javascript
  const enhancedContext = {
    ...context,
    platform,
    userId,
    transcriptionMethod: 'apple_speech',
    sessionId: context.sessionId || `session_${Date.now()}_${userId}`,
    startTime,
    integrations // Pass OAuth integration status from iOS app
  };
  ```

### 2. Email Agent (`emailAgent.js`)
- Modified `getEmails` method to check OAuth status from context first:
  ```javascript
  async getEmails(userId, filter = 'all', limit = 10, context = {}) {
    // Check if Gmail integration is active from iOS app context first
    const isActiveFromContext = context?.integrations?.google?.connected === true;
    
    // Only check database if context doesn't provide integration status
    let isActive = isActiveFromContext;
    if (!context?.integrations) {
      isActive = await this.gmailService.isIntegrationActive(userId);
    }
  ```
- Updated error handling to provide better feedback when Google isn't connected
- Modified `handleGetEmails` to pass context to `getEmails` method

## Result
The backend now properly recognizes when Google OAuth is connected based on the status sent from the iOS app, allowing email commands to work correctly without false "not connected" errors.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy these changes to the production server
2. Test with the iOS app to confirm the fix works end-to-end
3. Apply similar fixes to other agents (calendar, etc.) if needed
