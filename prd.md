## Identified User Flows
1. **Primary Voice Interaction Flow**:
   - User opens app on iPhone or Watch
   - Tap and hold microphone button to record
   - Voice is transcribed and sent to AI service
   - AI response is received as audio and played back
   - Conversation is saved to history

2. **Cross-Device Interaction Flow**:
   - User records voice on Watch
   - Audio is transmitted to iPhone for processing
   - iPhone handles transcription and AI communication
   - Response is sent back to Watch for playback
   - History is synchronized between devices

3. **Settings Management Flow**:
   - User accesses settings through gear icon
   - Can modify webhook URL for different AI services
   - Settings are persisted across app launches

4. **Menu Navigation Flow**:
   - User accesses hamburger menu
   - Can clear conversation history with confirmation
   - Additional menu options available for future features

## User Types (Detected from Code)
- **End Users**: Primary users who interact with the voice assistant through natural speech
  - Can record voice commands on iPhone or Watch
  - Receive audio responses with conversation history
  - Manage basic settings and conversation history

- **Developers/Administrators**: Users who configure the system
  - Can modify webhook URLs for different AI backends
  - Access to technical settings and configuration
  - Can deploy to different AI processing services

## Technical Architecture
### Database Schema
- **Local Storage**: UserDefaults for session and settings persistence
  - Session IDs, webhook URLs, voice preferences
  - First launch flags and user preferences

### API Structure
- **External Webhook Integration**: POST requests to n8n endpoint
  - Request: JSON with message, voiceId, sessionId
  - Response: Binary audio data or JSON with base64 audio
  - Timeout: 30-second request timeout

### Frontend Architecture
- **Shared Models**: Common data structures between iPhone and Watch
- **Device-Specific Views**: Tailored UI for each platform
- **Connector Classes**: WatchConnector (iPhone) and PhoneConnector (Watch)
- **Service Classes**: APIClient, SpeechRecognizer for core functionality

## Potential Improvements Identified
### Technical Debt
- **Single Webhook Dependency**: Relies on one external AI service
- **Limited Error Recovery**: Basic error handling without retry mechanisms
- **Audio Format Constraints**: Fixed audio format settings
- **Session Management**: Simple UUID-based sessions without advanced features

### Missing Features (Inferred)
- [ ] **Multiple AI Provider Support**: Support for different AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- [ ] **Conversation Search**: Search through conversation history
- [ ] **Voice Customization**: Different voice options for responses
- [ ] **Offline Mode**: Basic functionality without internet connection
- [ ] **Push Notifications**: Background processing and notifications
- [ ] **Cloud Sync**: Conversation history sync across devices
- [ ] **Usage Analytics**: Track usage patterns and performance
- [ ] **Accessibility Features**: Enhanced support for accessibility needs

### Security Considerations
- **Webhook URL Security**: Hardcoded webhook URL in source code
- **Audio Data Privacy**: No encryption for audio transmission
- **Session Security**: Basic session management without authentication
- **Data Retention**: No automatic conversation history cleanup

## Development Priorities (Suggested)
### High Priority
- **Security Hardening**: Implement secure webhook configuration
- **Error Recovery**: Add retry mechanisms for failed requests
- **Audio Quality**: Optimize audio format and compression settings
- **Performance**: Improve response times and memory usage

### Medium Priority
- **Feature Expansion**: Add multiple AI provider support

- **UI Polish**: Additional animations and visual enhancements
- **Admin Features**: Advanced configuration and management tools

## Success Criteria (Inferred)
- **Seamless Voice Interaction**: Natural, conversational AI responses
- **Cross-Device Functionality**: Reliable iPhone-Watch communication
- **User Adoption**: Intuitive interface encouraging regular use
- **Performance**: Fast response times and reliable audio processing
- **Reliability**: Consistent operation across different network conditions

## Notes from Codebase Analysis
