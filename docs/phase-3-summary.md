- Gradient background (blue to purple when idle, red to orange when recording)
- Pulsing outer ring animation when recording
- Audio level visualization that responds to voice input
- Shadow effects for depth

### 3. Quick Actions
- 5 predefined quick action buttons:
  - Schedule: "What's on my calendar today?"
  - Email: "Check my unread emails"
  - Tasks: "Show me my tasks for today"
  - Weather: "What's the weather like today?"
  - Time: "What time is it?"

### 5. Technical Improvements

## Code Changes

### ContentView.swift
- Removed duplicate QuickAction struct (using SharedModels version)
- Added responseText and showResponse state variables
- Enhanced UI components with modern styling
- Added processQuickAction method for handling quick commands
- Created SimpleQuickActionButton component

### Key Methods
```swift
// Process quick action commands
private func processQuickAction(_ action: QuickAction) {
    statusMessage = "Processing..."
    transcribedText = action.voiceCommand
    showResponse = false
    
    Task {
        // API call with circuit breaker
        // Update responseText and showResponse
    }
}
```

## Testing Status
- ✅ Build successful for iPhone 16 simulator
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ All UI elements properly integrated
- ⚠️ Backend still returns generic error (tracked as BACKEND-001)

## Next Steps
- Test on physical device
- Add more quick actions based on user feedback
- Consider adding voice feedback for responses
- Implement conversation history view
