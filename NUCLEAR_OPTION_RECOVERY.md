# Nuclear Option Recovery Documentation

## Current State (Phase 0: Minimal Working Build)

### What We Have Now
- ✅ App builds and runs without errors
- ✅ Fixed all compilation errors in ModelManagementView.swift
- ✅ Basic app structure with minimal ContentView
- ✅ Mock API client (MinimalAPIClient.swift)
- ✅ Basic audio recorder (MinimalAudioRecorder.swift)
- ✅ Stub MenuView to satisfy dependencies

### Files Modified/Created
1. **ContentView.swift** - Replaced with minimal implementation
2. **VoiceAssistantApp.swift** - Simplified to bypass authentication
3. **MinimalAudioRecorder.swift** - Basic audio recording functionality
4. **MinimalAPIClient.swift** - Mock API for testing
5. **MenuView.swift** - Stub to fix compilation
6. **ModelManagementView.swift** - Fixed multiple compilation errors

### Current App Capabilities
- Shows minimal UI with microphone button
- Can start/stop recording (basic functionality)
- Shows mock response after recording
- Bypasses all authentication and onboarding

## Recovery Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Recording (NEXT STEP)
**Goal**: Get real audio recording working with proper permissions

**Tasks**:
1. Update Info.plist with microphone permissions
2. Enhance MinimalAudioRecorder with proper audio session configuration
3. Add recording status indicators
4. Test on simulator and device
5. Add basic error handling

**Success Criteria**:
- Can record audio on device
- Shows proper recording indicators
- Handles permissions gracefully

### Phase 2: Real API Integration
**Goal**: Connect to backend API for transcription and responses

**Tasks**:
1. Update MinimalAPIClient with real API endpoints
2. Add proper authentication headers
3. Implement audio file upload
4. Parse API responses
5. Add network error handling

**Success Criteria**:
- Can send audio to API
- Receives and displays transcribed text
- Handles network errors gracefully

### Phase 3: Speech Recognition
**Goal**: Add on-device speech recognition

**Tasks**:
1. Integrate Apple Speech framework
2. Add speech recognition permissions
3. Implement real-time transcription
4. Add fallback to API transcription
5. Test accuracy and performance

**Success Criteria**:
- Real-time transcription during recording
- Seamless fallback to API when needed
- Good accuracy for common phrases

### Phase 4: Enhanced UI
**Goal**: Restore visual feedback and animations

**Tasks**:
1. Add waveform visualization
2. Implement recording animations
3. Add haptic feedback
4. Restore conversation history view
5. Add settings access

**Success Criteria**:
- Smooth animations
- Visual recording feedback
- No performance issues

### Phase 5: Watch Connectivity
**Goal**: Restore Apple Watch functionality

**Tasks**:
1. Re-enable WatchConnector
2. Test basic message passing
3. Add Watch app UI
4. Implement audio routing
5. Test on real devices

**Success Criteria**:
- Can initiate recording from Watch
- Audio plays on correct device
- Stable connection

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
**Goal**: Restore remaining features one by one

**Priority Order**:
1. Conversation history persistence
2. OAuth integration (Google, Spotify)
3. Offline mode
4. Batch processing
5. ML models and personalization
6. Analytics and monitoring
7. Advanced settings

## Testing Strategy

### After Each Phase:
1. Clean build
2. Run on simulator
3. Test on physical device
4. Check for memory leaks
5. Verify no regressions

### Red Flags to Watch For:
- Cascading import errors
- "Cannot find type" errors spreading
- Sudden increase in warnings
- Build time > 2 minutes
- Memory usage spikes

## Rollback Strategy

If adding a feature causes cascading errors:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Git stash or commit current changes
   - Revert to last working state
   - Clean build folder
   - Delete derived data

2. **Investigation**:
   - Identify the specific file causing issues
   - Check for circular dependencies
   - Look for protocol conformance issues
   - Verify all required imports

3. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Create feature in separate file first
   - Use protocols to decouple dependencies
   - Consider feature flags
   - Mock complex dependencies

## Current Known Issues

### Warnings to Address Later:
- Sendable conformance in various classes
- Unused variable warnings
- Deprecated API usage
- String interpolation with specifier

### Features Currently Disabled:
- Authentication flow
- Onboarding
- Dashboard view
- All OAuth integrations
- Analytics
- Watch app

## Build Configuration

### Current Settings:
- Target: iOS 17.0+
- Swift: 5.9
- Xcode: 15.x
- Architecture: arm64

### Build Flags:
- DEBUG mode enabled
- Authentication bypass active
- Mock services enabled

## Next Steps

1. **Backup Current State**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Nuclear option: Minimal working build achieved"
   ```

2. **Start Phase 1**:
   - Open `MinimalAudioRecorder.swift`
   - Add proper audio session configuration
   - Test recording functionality

3. **Document Progress**:
   - Update this file after each successful phase
   - Note any issues encountered
   - Track performance metrics

## Emergency Contacts

If you encounter issues:
1. Check this documentation first
2. Review git history for working states
3. Use `git bisect` to find breaking commits
4. Consider creating new minimal implementations

Remember: **Always test after each small change!**
